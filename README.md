/*****************************
*******GAME DESCRIPTION*******
*****************************/

Seven and a Half is a gambling game that is popular in Italy (as Sette e Mezzo), in Spain (as Siete y Media) in Brazil (as Sete e Meio) and probably in other places as well. In Italy it is traditionally played around Christmas. The objective is to collect cards that total as near as possible to 7Â½ without exceeding that number. 

A 40-card pack is used. It is possible to use a standard 52-card pack from which the 8's, 9's and 10's have been removed, but in Spain and parts of Italy it is customary to use a Latin-suited 40-card pack, with suits of Coins, Cups, Clubs and Swords. In any case, each suit consists of A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and three picture cards worth. The point values of the cards are:

Aces:	1 point each

2 to 7:	Face value

Picture cards:	Half a point each


The number of players is limited only by the size of the pack and the number of seats that can be fitted around the table. Deal and play are counter-clockwise.
